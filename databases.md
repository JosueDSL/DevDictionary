## Relational databases
Relational databases are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns. These databases have been the standard choice for many applications due to their robust consistency, support for complex queries, and adherence to **ACID** properties (**Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability**). Key features and benefits of relational databases include:

+ Structured data organization: Data in relational databases is stored in tables with a predefined schema.

+ Relationships and referential integrity: The relationships between tables in a relational database are defined by primary and foreign keys, ensuring referential integrity.

+ SQL support: Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying, manipulating, and managing data.

+ Transactions and ACID properties: Relational databases support transactions, which are sets of related operations that either succeed or fail as a whole. This feature ensures the ACID properties – Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability – are maintained, guaranteeing data consistency and integrity.

+ Indexing and optimization: Relational databases offer various indexing techniques and query optimization strategies, which help improve query performance and reduce resource consumption.

Relational databases also have some drawbacks:
+ Limited scalability: Scaling relational databases horizontally (adding more nodes) can be challenging.

+ Rigidity: The predefined schema in relational databases can make it difficult to adapt to changing requirements

+ Performance issues with large datasets
